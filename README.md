This project demonstrates how to integrate an Esri WebScene into a web application using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

The Legend widget displays symbols and labels representing the layers within the WebScene.

## Features

- Load and display a 3D WebScene from ArcGIS Online using its portal item ID.
- Integrate SceneView to view the WebScene in a 3D space with a global viewing mode.
- Add a Legend widget to the SceneView to describe the symbols used in the WebScene layers.

## Requirements

- An active internet connection to load the Esri ArcGIS API for JavaScript and the WebScene from ArcGIS Online.
- A Web browser that supports JavaScript and WebGL.
